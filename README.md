# OOP – Project Collection

---

## WORKS

This repository contains 6 Object-Oriented Programming projects, combining exercises in both **C++** (Works 1–4) and **C#** (Works 5–6).  
Each project focuses on core principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, operator overloading, and more.

---

#### WORK 1 – Banking System (C++)

Implements a mini banking system with four classes: `Person`, `Account`, `Transaction`, and `Bank`.  
- Supports deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and account ownership changes  
- Uses dynamic arrays and object composition  
- Emphasizes encapsulation and proper constructor use  
- Tests include multiple bank actions and state tracking

---

#### WORK 2 – Custom String Class (C++)

Recreates a `Str` class that mimics string behavior with manual memory management.  
- Implements full operator overloading: `+`, `=`, `==`, `[]`, `++`, casting, etc.  
- Handles dynamic allocation and deep copy  
- Includes edge-case handling for mutation and chaining  
- Tests validate correctness of operators and memory behavior

---

#### WORK 3 – Shape Inheritance System (C++)

Builds a geometric hierarchy with inheritance and polymorphism: `Shape` → `Circle`, `Quad`, `Square`.  
- Base class is abstract with virtual methods  
- Each shape has specific attributes (radius, sides, etc.)  
- Includes a polymorphic container `allShapes` to manage objects  
- Demonstrates overriding, upcasting, and cleanup via virtual destructors

---

#### WORK 4 – Student Sorting & Radio Controller (C++)

Contains 4 parts:
- `Vector<T>` template implementation with internal pointer logic  
- Save/load functionality for a `Student` class using binary files  
- A `Radio` class with frequency/volume control using operator overloading  
- Abstract `StuSorter` class with derived classes to sort students by name or average

---

#### WORK 5 – Drug Store Management System (C#)

A small C# program simulating an online cannabis pharmacy.  
- Class hierarchy for different drug types: `EyeDrops`, `Oil`, `Cream`, all inheriting from `Drug`  
- Central `Inventory` class to manage stock and validation  
- A `Date` class tracks drug expiry or registration  
- Business logic mimics real-world object modeling

---

#### WORK 6 – Israel Tour System (C#)

Models a travel agency handling Israeli trip data.  
- `Date`, `Trip`, and `IsraelTour` classes model real-world travel logic  
- Includes array of trips, filtering, and management logic  
- Tests demonstrate object initialization and flow of data  
- Reinforces inheritance and composition in C# OOP

---

## [Tests](#)

This section includes examples and past exams designed to test core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++.  
The tests cover a variety of topics and implementations, including:

- Templates and generic programming (e.g., vector-like classes)
- File I/O operations (save/load custom objects)
- Operator overloading (e.g., for custom classes like Radio, Clock, Complex)
- Inheritance and polymorphism (e.g., sorting strategies, virtual functions)
- Multiple inheritance and abstract class structures
- STL-based generic functions (e.g., filter/map using iterators)
- Tree structures and custom traversal logic
- Real-world modeling tasks (Zoo, Employees, Dogs)
