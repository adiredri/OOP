# OOP - C++

## WORKS

Object-Oriented Programming exercises focusing on classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and operator overloading.

---

#### [EX1_BankSystem](#)  
Implements a banking system with classes: Person, Account, Transaction, and Bank. Includes constructors and methods for withdrawals, deposits, account management, and transfers.

---

#### [EX2_StrOperators](#)  
Custom string class with full operator overloading: assignment, concatenation, comparison, indexing, increment (++), cast to int, character search, etc.

---

#### [EX3_ShapesInheritance](#)  
Inheritance between geometric shapes: Circle, Quad, Square, all derived from an abstract base class Shape. Uses virtual functions and polymorphic array handling.

---

#### [EX4_ZooPolymorphism](#)  
Zoo system with multiple inheritance and polymorphism. Includes classes like Mammals, Birds, Fish, GoldFish, Mermaid. Supports saving/loading to text and binary files.

## [Tests](#)

This section includes examples and past exams designed to test core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++.  
The tests cover a variety of topics and implementations, including:

- Templates and generic programming (e.g., vector-like classes)
- File I/O operations (save/load custom objects)
- Operator overloading (e.g., for custom classes like Radio, Clock, Complex)
- Inheritance and polymorphism (e.g., sorting strategies, virtual functions)
- Multiple inheritance and abstract class structures
- STL-based generic functions (e.g., filter/map using iterators)
- Tree structures and custom traversal logic
- Real-world modeling tasks (Zoo, Employees, Dogs)
