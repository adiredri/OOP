# OOP – Project Collection

---

This repository presents a collection of academic projects from an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course.  
It includes both C++ and C# implementations, each focusing on real-world modeling and solid object-oriented design.  
The projects cover topics such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, templates, and file I/O.

Projects range from banking systems and geometric modeling to sorting mechanisms, inventory management, and travel systems.  
They are implemented independently and demonstrate the use of reusable components and structured logic.

Key topics include:
- C++ with templates, binary/text file handling, and virtual methods  
- C# with class hierarchies, inheritance, and business logic design  
- Practical implementation of abstract programming concepts

## [WORKS](https://github.com/adiredri/OOP/tree/main/Works)

This section contains 6 OOP projects.  
Projects 1–4 are implemented in **C++**, and projects 5–6 in **C#**.

---

#### [EX1 – Banking System (C++)](https://github.com/adiredri/OOP/tree/main/Works/EX1_BankSystem)

Implements a mini banking system with four classes: `Person`, `Account`, `Transaction`, and `Bank`.  
- Supports deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and account ownership changes  
- Uses dynamic arrays and object composition  
- Emphasizes encapsulation and proper constructor use  
- Includes basic unit tests simulating banking operations

---

#### [EX2 – Custom String Class (C++)](https://github.com/adiredri/OOP/tree/main/Works/EX2_StrOperators)

Recreates a custom string class (`Str`) with manual memory handling.  
- Implements full operator overloading: `+`, `=`, `==`, `[]`, `++`, casting to `int`, etc.  
- Handles deep copy, mutation, and internal safety  
- Tests validate correctness of all operations and edge cases

---

#### [EX3 – Shape Inheritance System (C++)](https://github.com/adiredri/OOP/tree/main/Works/EX3_ShapesInheritance)

Implements a geometric hierarchy: `Shape` → `Circle`, `Quad`, `Square`.  
- Abstract base class with virtual methods  
- Demonstrates inheritance, overriding, and upcasting  
- Managed via a polymorphic container that holds all shapes

---

#### [EX4 – Zoo Polymorphism & Student Tools (C++)](https://github.com/adiredri/OOP/tree/main/Works/EX4_ZooPolymorphism)

A combined project featuring:
- `Vector<T>` generic class with pointer-based logic  
- Binary file handling for a `Student` class  
- `Radio` class using operator overloading for control  
- Sorting students using abstract `StuSorter` base class and derived strategies

---

#### [EX5 – Drug Store Management System (C#)](https://github.com/adiredri/OOP/tree/main/Works/EX5_DrugStore)

Simulates an online cannabis pharmacy.  
- Drug types (`EyeDrops`, `Oil`, `Cream`) inherit from a base `Drug` class  
- `Inventory` manages drug quantities and expiry  
- Includes date tracking and business validation logic  
- Fully object-oriented with clear separation of concerns

---

#### [EX6 – Israel Tour System (C#)](https://github.com/adiredri/OOP/tree/main/Works/EX6_IsraelTour)

Models a travel agency managing trip information.  
- Uses `Date`, `Trip`, and `IsraelTour` classes  
- Supports adding, filtering, and managing trips  
- Demonstrates encapsulation, composition, and use of arrays  
- Designed as a full OOP-based solution in C#

---

## [Tests](https://github.com/adiredri/OOP/tree/main/Tests)

This section contains official exams and custom test files to evaluate C++ OOP understanding.  
Topics covered:

- Templates and generic classes  
- File I/O and memory management  
- Operator overloading (`+`, `-`, `*`, `[]`, `()`, casting, etc.)  
- Inheritance and abstract class hierarchies  
- Binary trees, polymorphism, and data structures  
- Real-world modeling (e.g., Zoo, Employees, Dogs)
