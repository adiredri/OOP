### About
In this folder I will present a project that I did as part of my degree, it is about a travel agency that decided to computerize its travel data. For this purpose I used three classes:
* Date - a class that represents time
* Trip - a class that represents a trip
* IsraelTour - a department that represents the travel agency.
* Additionally, there is the main program department, where tests will be performed on the departments to check that everything is working properly.
